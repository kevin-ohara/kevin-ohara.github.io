I decided to try out Jekyll as my blogging platform of choice and the nerdy side of me really likes it.  I love its simplicity, that I get to use Git and it is really simple to host it on GitHub.  All good stuff.

The only thing that has bugged me so far is creating a new post is a big combersome, you have to create a file with a file name that includes the date in the correct format.  Also starting with an empty file I would have to paste in some boiler code.  All time consuming when all I want to do is write something before I lose interest.

So I made a little script and stuck it on [GitHub].

The script will prompt you for a title convert that to lower case and construct a file with the title and date in the correct format.  It also sticks in some boilerplate too.
