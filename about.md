I'm a software developer working in Belfast, trying to make the world a better place one commit at a time.  Mostly interested in web applications with Java but I have an open mind.

If you're bored you can catch me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/kev_ohara/) usually mumbling about the [Belfast Giants](http://belfastgiants.com).  Or on [LinkedIn](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/kevinjmohara) if you're really bored and want to see what I've worked on although you really should go read a book or something.

My views are my own, unless forced upon me by my wife.
